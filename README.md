# Customer-Retention-Analysis

This project focuses on understanding customer churn and retention trends using a structured data analysis approach. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover insights into which customer segments are more likely to churn.


**Project Files**

- `Customer_Retention_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all analysis steps and visualizations.
- `Telco_customer_churn.xlsx`: Raw dataset in Excel format used for analysis.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights**

The notebook covers a wide range of data exploration and visual storytelling techniques:

**Visualizations:**

- **Stacked Bar Charts**:
  - Tenure Months Distribution by Churn
  - Churn Rate by Contract Type
  - Churn Rate by Payment Method
  - Churn Rate by Internet Service, Streaming TV, Streaming Movies

- **Grouped Bar Charts**:
  - Demographics vs Churn: Senior Citizen, Gender, Dependents

- **Horizontal Bar Charts**:
  - Top 10 Churn Reasons
  - Top 10 Cities by Churn Count

- **Histograms**:
  - Distribution of Monthly Charges
  - Distribution of Customer Lifetime Value

- **Bar Charts (Churn vs Charges)**:
  - Monthly Charges by Churn
  - Total Charges by Churn

- **Correlation Heatmap**:
  - Feature Correlation Heatmap

Each chart is designed to highlight a specific factor affecting churn, such as contract type, tenure, service usage, and demographic patterns.

**Tech Stack**

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- OpenPyXL


## ðŸš€ How to Run

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-retention-analysis.git
cd customer-retention-analysis

**Objective**
To explore and understand key patterns in customer churn through data analysis and visualizations, without implementing machine learning models. The results can help guide retention strategies for telecom or subscription-based businesses.
